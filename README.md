This COVID-19 Cases Predictor program takes a machine learning approach to battling COVID-19 cases in America. Written in Python using tkinter, matplotlib, and scikit-learn, the easy-to-use UI permits users to display data of their choosing and run a polynomial regression model on the data to see how cases will tend towards in the future.

### Features
- National, State, and County Selection Data
- Regression Button that trains the model
- Navigation Bar to zoom into more or less recent dates
- Evaluation Summary of Model when tested with "outside" data

### How to Use
- Either clone or download this repo as a zip folder and extract files
- Keep main.py in same directory as images folder
- Run main.py

### My Purpose
Mostly inspired by the recent spikes in the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, I decided to use machine learning to tackle the problem starting at a fundamental community level. Most visuals out on the internet showcase either worldwide, national, or state data. While this data is beneficial to all, I believe that showing visuals at a county level will help bring a more personal awareness to how the pandemic has affected the community around us. Not only does this program make these visuals available to users, but by allowing them to run a regresion model, users can further see the potential implications on their communities if the current state of the pandemic continues to grow.

### Future Goals
The current goal is to further develop the regression model to where the program can distingiush between logistic, polynomial, and exponential trendlines and make a decision to which one fits the data best. Furthermore, I would love to take this project into augmented reality to showcase data in 3 dimensions.
